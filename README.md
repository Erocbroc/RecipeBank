# RecipeBank

The Recipe Bank Application is intended to help users decide on what to eat by providing a 
list of possible foods to make. This should ideally eliminate the thinking stage of food decision 
and immediately move on to meal prep as the user may select one choice out of possibly many. The 
program's effectiveness may be dependent on the number of recipe options saved in the user's database.

  - Executable file is located within the "Recipe Bank" folder.
  - Application.h file manages all the screens
  - Recipe.h file manages how recipies are saved/loaded

This Recipe Bank application uses the nana GUI framework. Source files for the GUI can be found at:
